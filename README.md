Module 6: WeatherPy with Python APIs

## Assignment Overview
The purpose of this assignment was to become familiar with utilizing APIs to obtain and analyze data that are provided by various companies and organizations. There is quite a limit on how much data an individual can get without APIs, especially those like map data. OpenWeatherMap API and Google Maps API were used in this project, which allowed me to successfully pick out potential vacation spots and the travel routes I can take to move around in said spots.
